# VLSI‑Learning‑Path 🐺

**Start‑to‑Finish Verilog & RTL design journey for a 2nd‑year ECE student, from single gates to a mini‑CPU.**  
Designed to build real-world VLSI foundations, improve debug skills, and share visible progress (simulation + GitHub) to stand out to VLSI recruiters.

## 🚀 Projects Included
- Module + self‑checked testbench for: AND, OR, XOR, 2:1 & 4:1 MUX, D/T/JK flip‑flops  
- Advanced RTL: 4‑bit up/down counter, shift‑register, FSM (traffic light), ALU, UART‑TX/RX, 16x8 RAM  
- MVP: A simple **mini‑CPU** implementing a 4‑instruction RISC-style ISA  
Each lab folder contains the `.v` files, waveform `.vcd` screenshots, and a README with explanations and block diagrams.

## 🎯 Why This Repository Exists
- To demonstrate **consistent coding discipline, wave-level debugging, and clear documentation** — essential if you aim for top-secret semiconductor internships (Qualcomm, Intel, Nvidia, Synopsys, TI, etc.)  
- To signal commitment to growth: a public record of learning that spans beginner → intermediate RTL blocks.  
- To serve as a **portable project portfolio** you can link in LinkedIn outreach, professor cold emails, or resume headers.
